T085,Redefine Customized Communities,Karen Green,2025-06-28,To Do,28,Resource unavailable,High,2025-07-21,High Risk Task,"Here is the analysis:

**Summary of the issue:**

Task T085, assigned to Karen Green, is delayed by 28 days and is currently blocked due to a resource unavailability issue. The task is critical to the Redefine Customized Communities project, and its delay has a high impact on the client. The task remains in the ""To Do"" status, indicating that no work has been started yet.

**Recommended next step:**

The project manager should:

1. Reach out to Karen Green to understand the specific resource requirements for Task T085 and the expected timeframe for availability.
2. Identify alternative resources or temporary solutions to mitigate the delay, if possible.
3. Negotiate with the client to discuss the impact of the delay and explore options for adjusting the deadline or scope, if necessary.
4. Update the project schedule and communicate the changes to the team and stakeholders.

By taking these steps, the project manager can work towards resolving the blocker, minimizing the impact on the client, and ensuring the project stays on track."
